# Credit_Card_Dataset
Credit_Card_Dataset with PCA and K_means

I worked on an exciting data science project focusing on customer segmentation using various clustering techniques. Hereâ€™s a quick summary:

1- Data Preprocessing & Exploration:

Loaded and cleaned a dataset containing customer credit card data.
Addressed missing values by imputing them based on business logic and statistical measures.
Filtered out extreme outliers to ensure robust analysis.

2- Data Visualization:

Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions and correlations.
Generated histograms for numerical features and a heatmap to identify strong correlations.

3- Outlier Detection:

Identified outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Counted the number of outliers in each feature to understand data distribution.

4- Dimensionality Reduction:

Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving key variance in the data.
Visualized the PCA-transformed data in 2D to observe natural clusters.

5- Clustering Techniques:

Implemented K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.
Evaluated the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and Silhouette score.
Experimented with the DBSCAN algorithm to detect non-linear clusters and noise within the data.

6- Insights & Visualization:

Plotted the clusters on PCA-transformed axes to visualize customer segments.
Compared different clustering algorithms to identify the most effective approach for the dataset.
This project has deepened my understanding of clustering techniques and their application in real-world scenarios. Excited to apply these insights to future projects!
